# CETO2022
This repository is made for my findings in attempt to solve problem from Computer Experiment Team Olympiad 2022

Computer Experiment Team Olympiad is a team competition organised by students from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. The competition is organised for students of 9th-11th grade, but I decided to try to solve myself one of the tasks. I have already participated previously in this olympiad as the school student and worked on the similar problem from CETO 2019 Autumn that later inspired me for my research with which I have reached National level of Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

By doing this small research I want to practise my math skills as well as skills with Jupyter notebooks
